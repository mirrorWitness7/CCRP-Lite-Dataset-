## 🌍 Overview  
**CCRP-Lite** is an open, educational dataset that demonstrates how collapse–coherence–rebuild (CCRP) cycles can be modeled as data.  
Each entry captures a simplified governance scenario — human, organizational, or multi-agent — encoded in JSON format for clarity and machine readability.  

This is a **public-safe, optics-ready subset** of the full CCRP framework used in adaptive AI governance research.

## ⚙️ Dataset Structure  

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `ccrp_lite_dataset.json` | Core dataset: structured examples of collapse → paradox → rebuild cycles. |
| `generate_dataset.py` | Lightweight generator script used to build the dataset. |
| `README.md` | Documentation for research and educational use. |

Each record includes:  
```json
{
  "phase": "collapse | paradox | rebuild",
  "context": "organizational / AI governance / social dynamic",
  "entropy_score": 0.72,
  "coherence_shift": 0.85,
  "lesson": "System adapts by replacing rigid control with reciprocal feedback."
}
```

## 🔬 Research Context  
The **Collapse-Coherence-Rebuild Protocol (CCRP)** models resilience under uncertainty.  
This dataset offers a minimal, interpretable form of that logic — usable for:  
- Teaching adaptive governance principles  
- Simulating entropy-driven decision processes  
- Benchmarking early-stage AI risk-response models

## 🧩 Educational Purpose  
> “Reading collapse as a pattern, not a failure.”  

This dataset is designed for demonstration and discussion.  
It does **not** represent personal data, institutional records, or live system output.
